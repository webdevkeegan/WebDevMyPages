[{"description":"HURDL is a small development humanitarian assistance research and implementation lab within the George Perkins Marsh Institute at Clark University. We are engaged in projects that range from policy development to project design and implementation. This diverse portfolio of activities is unified by a shared belief that, by and large, the challenges we see in the Global South are products of various forms of risk and uncertainty that limit the potential for locally-generated innovations that could change the lives of the global poor. We believe that developmentâ€™s role in changing the world lies in building a foundation for these local innovations by working with individuals and communities to address this risk and uncertainty."}]
